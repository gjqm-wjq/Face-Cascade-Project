# Face Detection using Haar Cascade Classifier

This project demonstrates face detection using the Haar Cascade classifier in OpenCV.

## Overview

The project performs the following tasks:

- Loads pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier for face detection.
- Iterates through images in a specified folder.
- Detects faces in the images and draws rectangles around them.
- Determines true labels based on filenames.
- Predicts labels based on the presence of detected faces.
- Calculates confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
